# ProsperLoan Data Exploration
## by Jie Hawes


## Dataset

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. The project objective is not expected to explore all of the variables in the dataset! I elimiated some of the variables and kept the variables of interest that may be significant factors for the original loan amount and monthly loan payment for professionals out of all the borrowers.


## Summary of Findings

Most of the borrowers are homeowners with a percentage of 51.66% out of all borrowers. 
Most borrowers have income range from 25,000-49,999. Most borrowers have loan term of 36 months.   
Most loan status is current and most borrowers are employed.
Professionals is the majority of the prosper loan borrowers. Most of the professionals reside in Califronia. The trends of their credit grade and loan status are consistent with all the borrwowers.       
We found that their highest income range also have the most spread monthly payment amount comparing with lower range like 25,000-49,999. The credit grades of AA, A and B do not show extensive difference in the spread of plots whereas credit grades of HR and E all have lower monthly payment despite the debt to income ratios.     
The prosper ratings of AA, A, B, and C for professionals with income higher than 25,000 all took the largest amount of loan originally. Professionals with income range below 25,000 show either a high standard deviation or lower/none smaple values.


## Key Insights for Presentation

In the presentation, I first explored overall borrowers' status regarding loan status, income range, exployment status, occupations, then I mainly focued on the professionals as the largest group of the borrowers. One thing during the analysis, I raised one question regarding the employment status. I pointed out that "employed" may include "full-time", "part-time", "self-employed", etc. However, it was also listed as a single value equavlent to the others. This may cause some inaccuracy in interpreting the results. However, this can only be traced back to the data collection. With the results I obtained, the major findings are that the trend of loan status and credit grade the professionals are consistent with the trend of all borrowers.I observed the bimodal effect of the credit grade for how the income range of the professionals affects their monthly payment. The debt to income ratio is not as significant as other factors. Same trend for the prosper ratings with respect to the original loan amount is valid for only professionals with income higher than 25,000.

In conclusion, the monthly loan payment for professional is highly dependent on the income range for better credit grade only. The original loan amount also depends on the prosper ratings only for the professional with higher income range.
